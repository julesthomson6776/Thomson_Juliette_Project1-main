 Building a website for a energy drink using typography

 This website is for an energy drink company. This website has the focal point of typography and color. I used bright colors to bring the pop into the website, I used big bold lettering so its in your face once you open the website. I used mainly css and html for this code, I used containers to hold all the information and images into the middle of the page.
